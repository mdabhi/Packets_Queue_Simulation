This project aims to prepare the queue model simulation in order to help analyze/study the behavior of various queue models.
The models covered in this project are,
- M/M/1 queue
- D/M/1 queue 
- M/G/1 queue
- M/D/1 queue
- M/D/2 queue
- M/D/1/k queue

This project consists of only 1 code file Queue_Simulation_final.c, developed and compiled on Code::Blocks IDE, Windows environment.

Learning :
    This project helped me to explore and learn,
    - How do the various queues behave 
    - How to simulate any model, design the simulation code
    - Practice modular coding in 'C'
